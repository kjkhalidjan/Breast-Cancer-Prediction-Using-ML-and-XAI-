          <p>Kashmir is in the grip of a silent epidemic as cancer cases continue to surge, a distressing reality underscored by the substantial increase in registrations at two prominent tertiary care hospitalsâ€”Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) and Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) Hospital.

            According to the gathered data, SKIMS has documented a staggering 44,112 cancer cases from 2013 to 2023, indicating a profound health crisis unfolding in the Valley. SMHS hospital has reported 6,379 cases from 2017 to 2023, emphasising the magnitude of the issue.

            The concentration of cancer patients seeking treatment in these hospitals underscores the severity of the issue and points towards a significant rise in cancer incidence in Kashmir.

            A detailed breakdown of the SKIMS data exposes a concerning progression of cancer cases over the years. In 2014, 3,930 patients were diagnosed, with the numbers steadily increasing each year. The data reveals 4,417 cases in 2015, 4,320 in 2016, 4,352 in 2017, 4,816 in 2018, 4,337 in 2019, 3,814 in 2020, 4,727 in 2021, 5,294 in 2022, and up to September 2023, 4,095 cancer registrations. This brings the total tally of cancer registrations at SKIMS from 2014 to September 2023 to a staggering 44,112.

          <p>"The most common tumor in males was lung cancer and in females breast cancer. This scenario looks very grim as far as lung being the most common tumor in males is concerned because this cancer has a direct bearing and relation with tobacco use," he said.

            "This indicates the magnitude of tobacco products in our society and how much awareness we have to make among the general public regarding the use of tobacco," he said.

            As far as breast cancer in females is concerned, one of the major reasons is the lack of physical activity and obesity. "So both the common cancers, whether it is lung in males or breast in females, could be easily avoided if we make the change in lifestyle," Prof Ahmad said.
